    <article class="mt-8 space-y-6 text-white/80 leading-relaxed">
      <p>Luxury rentals in South Delhi and Gurgaon are seeing record interest this year. With expats, diplomats, and corporate executives returning, demand for independent floors and farmhouses is surging.</p>

      <p>Unlike earlier cycles, tenants are willing to pay a premium for privacy, parking, and turnkey finishes. Popular areas like Defence Colony, Vasant Vihar, Westend, and the Lutyens Bungalow Zone (LBZ) are witnessing bidding competition, something previously seen only in purchase markets.</p>

      <p>For landlords, this shift means reduced vacancy periods and stronger rental yields. For tenants, it emphasizes the need to act quickly once a verified option appears. In Gurgaon, the Golf Course Road belt continues to attract CXOs who want modern towers with concierge services.</p>

      <p><strong>RK Estates takeaway:</strong> If you’re considering leasing in 2025, prepare documents early and be clear on budgets. The best listings are closing in days, not weeks.</p>
