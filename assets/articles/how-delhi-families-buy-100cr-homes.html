        The myth says big cheque. The market rewards speed, structure, and a clean trail. This is how nine figure deals actually close.

      <p class="lead mt-6">
        Say South Delhi bungalow or Golf Course penthouse and most people picture the same scene. A billionaire signs a cheque and it is done.
        That is not how it works. Not anymore.
      </p>

      <div class="divider my-8"></div>

      <h2>The myth and the reality</h2>
      <p>
        Above fifty crores, cash is slow. It is risky. It is expensive. Sellers, banks, and lawyers optimise for certainty and compliance.
        The families that win arrive with proof of funds, escrow terms, and pre approved credit lines. The families that lose arrive with promises.
      </p>

      <h2>Why cash is out of the picture</h2>
      <p>
        Currency in circulation is higher than 2016. Yet ultra luxury deals have moved on book. Not because buyers cannot pay.
        Because clean structure is worth more than drama. Sanction letters travel. Source of funds trails stand up years later.
      </p>

      <div class="callout p-5 mt-6">
        <div class="flex items-center gap-2 mb-2"><span class="rk-chip">FEMA BASICS</span></div>
        <ul>
          <li>Overseas inflows route through NRE or NRO accounts only.</li>
          <li>Keep proof: inward remittance, bank advice, KYC. You will need them at resale.</li>
          <li>Match calendars: funds arrival, diligence, and registry should align before you bid.</li>
        </ul>
      </div>

      <div class="divider my-10"></div>

      <h2>The capital stack behind a clean deal</h2>
      <p>Forget the single cheque fantasy. Big purchases are stitched together. Here are the pieces we see most often.</p>

      <h3>Family asset shuffle</h3>
      <p>
        Old factories or warehouses get sold. Siblings rebalance stakes. Timing aligns with tax windows. That is the first source of real purchase capital.
      </p>

      <h3>Securities backed speed</h3>
      <p>
        Loan against securities on listed portfolios unlocks liquidity in two to three days. Costly, yes. But decisive when two families want the same house.
      </p>

      <h3>Promoter credit lines</h3>
      <p>
        Share pledge facilities move large sums fast. More expensive than LAS. Often the difference between winning and watching.
      </p>

      <h3>NRI remittances</h3>
      <p>
        Routed through NRE or NRO accounts. Sometimes staged across financial years. Compliance first. Convenience second.
      </p>

      <h3>Bridge finance</h3>
      <p>
        NBFC or private credit bridges cover six to twelve months. The meter runs high. Families use it when timing is everything.
      </p>

      <h3>Bank loans and declared savings</h3>
      <p>
        Still part of the picture. Rarely the core piece at the very top end.
      </p>

      <div class="divider my-10"></div>

      <h2>Two playbooks that win</h2>

      <h3>The 90 day bridge</h3>
      <p class="quote">
        A family pledges a large stock portfolio. Draws an overdraft. Locks token and stage one. Closes. Repays from a planned asset sale.
        They beat a higher bidder who could not evidence funds on day one.
      </p>

      <h3>The NRI split buy</h3>
      <p class="quote">
        Two siblings abroad want independent homes near parents. Settlement frees capital. Remittances are staged. A small local loan smooths timing.
        Both registries complete within weeks.
      </p>

      <div class="divider my-10"></div>

      <h2>Buyer checklist</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Carry a proof of funds pack: sanction letter, banker contact, escrow terms.</li>
        <li>Keep a buffer in every LAS line. Margin calls do not wait for registry.</li>
        <li>Run a single calendar: remittance, pledge, diligence, and registry aligned before you negotiate.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Seller checklist</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Ask for banker introductions. Not promises.</li>
        <li>Use escrow or staged payments tied to diligence milestones.</li>
        <li>Value certainty. A buyer who closes in thirty days can be worth more than a higher price with a ninety day wait.</li>
      </ul>

      <div class="divider my-10"></div>

      <h2>Common trip ups</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Margin calls on pledged portfolios when markets wobble.</li>
        <li>FEMA gaps where funds and registry dates do not match.</li>
        <li>Succession gaps when families skip trusts or wrappers and transfers become messy later.</li>
      </ul>

      <div class="divider my-10"></div>

      <h2>The hidden rules of this market</h2>
      <p>
        No one buys on impulse. The work starts months before a listing appears. The families that win structure exits before they enter.
        They pay for speed and certainty. Not for noise.
      </p>

      <div class="divider my-10"></div>
