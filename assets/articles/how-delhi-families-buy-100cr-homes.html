    <p class="mb-4">
      When headlines scream about a ₹70 Cr bungalow in Shanti Niketan or a ₹90 Cr penthouse on Golf Course Road, the reactions are predictable: disbelief, envy, curiosity.
      For most of us, these numbers feel otherworldly. But if you’ve ever wondered <em>“Who’s really buying these homes — and how are they paying for them?”</em>
      the answer might surprise you.
    </p>

    <p class="mb-4">
      At RK Estates, we see the reality every day. And it isn’t one fat cheque from a Swiss account. It’s a carefully stitched‑together puzzle of family planning,
      finance, and timing.  Luxury real estate isn’t just about brick and mortar.  It’s about how capital is raised, moved and secured.
    </p>

    <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-white mt-8 mb-4">The Invisible Capital Stack</h2>
    <p class="mb-4">Big transactions are rarely funded in a single way.  Instead, buyers layer different sources together.  Here’s what we see in 2025:</p>
    <ul class="list-disc ml-6 space-y-3 mb-6">
      <li><strong>Family settlements & inheritance:</strong> rebalancing family assets — selling warehouses, splitting business stakes — to free up capital.</li>
      <li><strong>Loan against securities (LAS):</strong> pledging equity portfolios to raise short‑term lines that lock deals quickly.</li>
      <li><strong>Promoter liquidity lines:</strong> business owners pledge shares to raise large sums in days.</li>
      <li><strong>Private credit / NBFC bridges:</strong> credit funds provide interim funding backed by the property itself.</li>
      <li><strong>NRI remittances:</strong> families abroad remit funds through NRE/NRO accounts under RBI/FEMA rules.</li>
      <li><strong>Bank loans & declared savings:</strong> traditional on‑book funding still plays a part even at high ticket sizes.</li>
      <li><strong>Asset swaps:</strong> selling commercial property to fund a legacy home in South Delhi.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-white mt-8 mb-4">Two stories that say it all</h2>
    <p class="mb-4"><strong>The 90‑day bridge:</strong> one Delhi family pledged a ₹300 Cr equity portfolio to raise a 90‑day overdraft.  With that liquidity
      they locked a Vasant Vihar deal in weeks.  Ninety days later, they sold a warehouse to clear the loan.  Speed won them the home.</p>
    <p class="mb-4"><strong>The NRI split-buy:</strong> two siblings living abroad wanted independent homes in Delhi. Through a family settlement, remittances,
      and a local loan, both secured homes in the same colony — registry completed within weeks.</p>

    <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-white mt-8 mb-4">Why this matters</h2>
    <p class="mb-4">
      You may not be buying a ₹100 Cr home tomorrow. But if you’re considering a ₹10–20 Cr upgrade, the same principles apply: sellers prefer buyers who can show
      liquidity clearly, and buyers who understand funding tools can negotiate better and avoid costly delays.
    </p>

    <p class="mb-4">
      In Delhi, buying a home is never just about the property.  It’s about how the deal is made possible.  At RK Estates, our role is to decode this invisible
      capital stack so clients buy with confidence, sellers close with certainty, and families avoid costly mistakes.
