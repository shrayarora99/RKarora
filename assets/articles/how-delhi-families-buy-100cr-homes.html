      <h2>The Myth Everyone Believes</h2>
      <p>A ₹85 crore Lutyens bungalow comes up for sale. Everyone imagines a billionaire writes a cheque and moves in the next week.</p>
      <p><strong>Wrong.</strong> Above ₹50 crores, nobody pays in cash. Not because they can’t. Because cash is slow, risky, and attracts scrutiny.</p>

      <div class="divider"></div>

      <h2>Why Cash Isn’t King Anymore</h2>
      <p>India’s cash in circulation has doubled since 2016. From ₹17 lakh crore to ₹34 lakh crore in 2024. Yet in the ultra-luxury bracket, almost none of it touches property deals.</p>
      <p>Sellers, lawyers, and banks demand documented flows. Escrow confirmations. Banker introductions. Proof of funds. Cash slows the deal and raises red flags.</p>
      <p>In mid-segment properties cash still plays a role. Once you cross ₹50 crores the game flips. Speed and compliance are what matter.</p>

      <div class="divider"></div>

      <h2>The Headline Everyone Saw</h2>
      <p>In October 2024, Sidhant Real Estate, linked to the DLF chairman’s family, acquired a Prithviraj Road bungalow for around ₹150 crores.</p>
      <p>The number made headlines. The structure did not. Even those who could pay cash chose a corporate wrapper. That is the real story: efficiency, succession, safety.</p>

      <div class="divider"></div>

      <h2>The Capital Stack</h2>

        <figcaption class="rk-caption">Indicative mix based on RK Estates advisory experience</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p class="mt-6">Here is how ₹90–120 crore deals are actually funded:</p>
      <ul class="list-disc ml-6 space-y-2">
        <li><strong>Family asset shuffle.</strong> Sale of factories, commercial blocks, or legacy holdings. Timed with tax exemptions.</li>
        <li><strong>Securities backed speed.</strong> LAS against portfolios worth hundreds of crores. Liquidity in 48–72 hours.</li>
        <li><strong>Promoter credit lines.</strong> Share pledges move ₹50+ crores in days. Expensive but decisive.</li>
        <li><strong>NRI remittances.</strong> Routed through NRE/NRO accounts. Capped at USD 1 million annually per person. Compliance is everything.</li>
        <li><strong>Bridge finance.</strong> NBFCs provide 6–12 month loans against property. Costly but sometimes necessary.</li>
        <li><strong>Bank loans and declared savings.</strong> Still part of the picture. Rarely dominant.</li>
      </ul>

      <div class="divider"></div>

      <h2>Stories From The Ground</h2>
      <h3>The 90-Day Bridge</h3>
      <p class="rk-quote">A family pledged a ₹300 crore stock portfolio, drew a short overdraft, and locked a Vasant Vihar deal. Three months later, a warehouse sale cleared the loan. They beat a higher bidder by proving liquidity day one.</p>
      
      <h3>The Sibling Split Buy</h3>
      <p class="rk-quote">Two NRIs wanted independent homes near parents. A family settlement freed capital. Overseas remittances were staged. A small local LAP bridged the gap. Both deals closed within weeks.</p>

      <div class="divider"></div>

      <h2>Buyer Checklist</h2>
      <ul class="list-disc ml-6 space-y-2">
        <li>Prepare a proof-of-funds pack before you negotiate</li>
        <li>Keep buffer in LAS lines to avoid margin calls</li>
        <li>Match calendar: remittance, LAS, diligence, registry all aligned</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Seller Checklist</h2>
      <ul class="list-disc ml-6 space-y-2">
        <li>Ask for banker introductions, not promises</li>
        <li>Prefer escrow or staged payments linked to milestones</li>
        <li>Value certainty: a 30-day closer is worth more than a 90-day promise</li>
      </ul>

      <div class="divider"></div>

      <h2>The Pitfalls</h2>
      <ul class="list-disc ml-6 space-y-2">
        <li><strong>Margin calls.</strong> Over-pledged equities force sales at the worst time</li>
        <li><strong>FEMA traps.</strong> Mistimed remittances make resale painful</li>
        <li><strong>Succession gaps.</strong> Families without trusts or wrappers risk disputes and delays</li>
      </ul>

      <div class="divider"></div>

      <h2>The Bigger Picture</h2>
      <p>Delhi’s richest don’t just buy mansions. They engineer acquisitions. Months of prep, banker coordination, lawyers, tax advisors. All so they can move the moment the right property appears.</p>
      <p>The number in the paper is the final line. The real story is the capital stack that made it possible.</p>
      <p>At RK Estates we build that stack for our clients. So buyers move with confidence. Sellers close with certainty. And legacies stay intact.</p>
