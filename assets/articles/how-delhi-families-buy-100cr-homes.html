        Headlines show the price. Real deals are built on structure: family decisions, financing, and timing.
        Here’s a clear, practical walkthrough of how high-ticket purchases really close in Delhi.

      <p class="mt-6">
        When a ₹70 Cr bungalow in Shanti Niketan or a ₹90 Cr penthouse on Golf Course Road trades hands, most people ask:
        <em>“Who is buying this—and how are they paying for it?”</em>
        The honest answer is: very few write a single cheque. Delhi’s largest deals are mosaics—layered funding assembled
        to be fast, compliant, and low-friction for both sides.
      </p>

      <div class="divider my-8"></div>

      <h2>What really sits behind the cheque</h2>
      <p>
        Buyers assemble a <strong>capital stack</strong>—multiple sources used together. The pieces that appear
        most often in 2025:
      </p>
      <ul class="rk-list list-disc ml-6">
        <li><strong>Family settlements & inheritance</strong> – rebalancing family assets to create purchase capital.</li>
        <li><strong>Loan-Against-Securities (LAS)</strong> – pledging listed portfolios for a quick overdraft to lock the deal.</li>
        <li><strong>Promoter liquidity lines</strong> – share-pledge credit lines that move in days.</li>
        <li><strong>Private credit / NBFC bridge</strong> – short-tenor, property-backed funding when timing is tight.</li>
        <li><strong>NRI remittances</strong> – official NRE/NRO flows under RBI/FEMA, often paired with local leverage.</li>
        <li><strong>Bank loans & declared savings</strong> – on-book funding remains part of the mix even at high tickets.</li>
        <li><strong>Asset swaps</strong> – selling commercial/industrial assets to buy legacy homes.</li>
      </ul>

      <!-- RBI / FEMA CALL-OUT -->
      <div class="rk-callout p-5 mt-8">
        <div class="flex items-center gap-2 mb-2">
          <span class="rk-chip">RBI / FEMA BASICS</span>
        </div>
        <ul class="rk-list list-disc ml-6">
          <li>Payments must flow through banking channels (NRE/NRO/FCNR). No cash/travel cards.</li>
          <li>Keep proofs: inward remittance, KYC, and bank advice—these matter at resale/repatriation.</li>
          <li>Coordinate registry timelines with remittance arrival and bank legal vetting.</li>
        </ul>
      </div>

      <div class="divider my-10"></div>

      <h2>Two real-world playbooks</h2>

      <h3>1) The 90-day bridge (speed beats price)</h3>
      <p class="rk-quote">
        A Delhi family pledged a large listed portfolio and drew a 90-day OD. That locked a South Delhi floor in weeks.
        Proceeds from a warehouse sale cleared the line before maturity. They won against a higher bidder who
        couldn’t evidence funds fast enough.
      </p>

      <h3>2) The NRI split-buy (one decision, two homes)</h3>
      <p class="rk-quote">
        Two siblings abroad wanted independent homes close to parents. Family settlement + phased remittances + a
        small LAP against another city asset = synchronized registries within weeks, zero friction.
      </p>

      <div class="divider my-10"></div>

      <h2>Buyer playbook: look financially “ready”</h2>
      <ul class="rk-list list-disc ml-6">
        <li>Line up a <strong>proof-of-funds pack</strong>: LAS sanction / bank line, banker contact, escrow readiness.</li>
        <li>Match <strong>timelines</strong>: remittances, portfolio pledge, private-credit paperwork, registry slot.</li>
        <li>Use <strong>bridge + refinance</strong>: lock first, repay from later asset sale to avoid missing the house.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2 class="mt-8">Seller playbook: separate signal from noise</h2>
      <ul class="rk-list list-disc ml-6">
        <li>Ask for a <strong>sanction letter or banker intro</strong>, not just a promise.</li>
        <li>Prefer buyers offering <strong>escrow or staged payments</strong> aligned to diligence milestones.</li>
        <li>Set a <strong>tight but realistic calendar</strong>: token → legal → registry. Certainty is worth price.</li>
      </ul>

      <div class="divider my-10"></div>

      <h2>Common trip-ups (and how to avoid them)</h2>
      <ul class="rk-list list-disc ml-6">
        <li><strong>LAS margin calls:</strong> keep a buffer; don’t run your line at 99% in a volatile week.</li>
        <li><strong>Remittance delays:</strong> initiate early, reconcile SWIFT refs, and book registry after funds land.</li>
        <li><strong>Title surprises:</strong> align lawyers early; don’t discover society/utility issues on registry day.</li>
      </ul>

      <div class="divider my-10"></div>

      <h2>The bigger picture</h2>
      <p>
        Premium housing demand is being driven less by speculation and more by structured, multi-source capital.
        Understanding this is the difference between <em>hoping</em> a transaction closes and <em>engineering</em> it to close.
      </p>

      <div class="divider my-10"></div>

      <h2>RK Estates view</h2>
      <p>
        Our role isn’t to spam listings. It’s to design the path to a smooth registry—mapping your funding stack,
        sequencing paperwork, and negotiating certainty on both sides. If you’re evaluating a purchase or sale,
        we can pressure-test the numbers and the calendar before you commit.
